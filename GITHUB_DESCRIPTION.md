## 🎵 What is Vibe Coding?

> *"There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."*  
> — **Andrej Karpathy**

**Conch** is the first C++ framework built from the ground up for the AI-assisted development era.

**Stop configuring. Start vibing.** 🎵
